                        My first real encounter with JavaScript was during my internship in
                        the last semester at university. Within 4 month, me and two of my classmates
                        were supposed to develop an hybrid mobile application with Ionic 2. So it's
                        fair to say I started to learn JavaScript through Angular 2 (... yeah I know).
                        We got the hang of it pretty and the usage of interpolation blew our minds.

                        I've always had an interest of programming, so of course I continued coding
                        Ionic applications on my free time. Writing code in Typescript and Angular felt natural
                        coming from my pretty C#-focused education, structruring the code
                        in a some what MVC fashion made sence even here.

                        framework, called React. I remember taking a 1s look into it and throught

                        I was even coding in StencilJS before gicing React a real chance. Haven't
                         heard of it? Exactly. But after playing around with StencilJS
                        and getting the idea of states and props, it turned out that JSX wasn't 
                        that bad after all...
